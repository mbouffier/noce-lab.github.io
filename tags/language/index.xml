We used fMRI to study how the brain categorizes multisensory objects using words.</description></item><item><title>Losing words &amp; concepts</title><link>https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/research/losing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/research/losing/</guid><description>We investigate which neural substrate are critical for language and semantic processing. So far we have focused on:
the role played by the left and right anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in, respectively, verbal and nonverbal semantic (Borghesani et al., Cortex, 2019; Borghesani et al., NeuroImage:Clinical, 2020; Borghesani et al., Aphasiology, 2019) how ATL damage can be (partially) compensated by the over recruitment of spared dorsal and posterior areas (Borghesani et al.</description></item><item><title>Representing words &amp; concepts</title><link>https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/research/representing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 07:37:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noce-lab.github.io/posts/research/representing/</guid><description>We study the neuro-cognitive correlates of semantic knowledge (Borghesani &amp;amp; Piazza, Neuropsychologia, 2017). So far, we have seen how different concept features
are encoded in distributed yet specialized cortical representations, with crucial topographical dissociations describing a posterior-to-anterior gradient from perceptual to conceptual features (Borghesani et al., Neuroimage, 2016) are automatically and rapidly retrieved when presented with symbolic information (Borghesani et al., JoCN, 2018) according to the task the subject is performing (Borghesani et al.</description></item></channel></rss>
